# FOS â€“ Ain Shams University Educational Operating System

**FOS** is an educational operating system developed for the Operating Systems course at Ain Shams University. It is a refactored version of MIT's JOS (6.828) lab, tailored to enhance students' understanding of OS concepts through hands-on experience.

## Key Features

- **Memory Management**: Implements dynamic memory allocation using strategies like First Fit, Best Fit, and Next Fit.

- **Paging and Virtual Memory**: Supports kernel heap allocation, page fault handling, and page replacement algorithms such as the Clock algorithm.

- **Concurrency**: Provides semaphores with operations like `CreateSemaphore`, `SIGNAL`, and `WAIT`, enabling synchronization in multi-threaded environments.

- **User-Level Memory Management**: Includes user heap functions such as `malloc`, `free`, and shared memory operations.

- **System Calls and Debugging**: Offers a set of system calls for process management and debugging, facilitating the development and testing of OS components.

## Development Tools

- **FOSv1**: Utilizes Bochs as the emulator and Eclipse for development, providing a traditional setup for OS development.

- **FOSv2**: Enhances the development environment by integrating QEMU for faster emulation and Visual Studio Code for a more efficient coding experience.

## Educational Resources

The course provides comprehensive materials, including lab assignments and project guidelines, to support students in their learning journey. These resources are accessible through the university's official channels.
